# Twitter Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with their Twitter credentials at this HumHub installation.
A new button "Twitter" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please go to the [Twitter Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/apps/) to create the required `OAuth client ID` credentials.

Once you have the **Client Key** and **Client Secret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> Twitter Auth -> Settings`.
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in Twitter in the corresponding field.
